    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let string1 = "something";
    let string2 = string1;

    console.log(string1, string2);

    string1 = "somebody";

    console.log(string1, string2);

    let number1 = 1;
    let number2 = number1;

    console.log(number1, number2);

    number1 = 2;

    console.log(number1, number2);

    boolean1 = true;
    boolean2 = boolean1;

    console.log(boolean1, boolean2);

    boolean1 = false;
    console.log(boolean1, boolean2);

    // CONCLUSION: Strings, numbers and boolean are copied through assigning value

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    let copy_players = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    copy_players.push("Harry");
    console.log(players, copy_players);  // BOTH arrays are modified

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    let real_copy_players = players.slice();
    real_copy_players.push("Johnny");
    console.log(players, real_copy_players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    let real_copy_players_2 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(real_copy_players_2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    let real_copy_players_3 = [...players];
    real_copy_players_3[0] = "Barry";
    console.log(players, real_copy_players_3);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    let real_copy_players_4 = Array.from(players);
    real_copy_players_4[0] = "Billy";
    console.log(players, real_copy_players_4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const newPerson = person;
    newPerson.age = 70;
    console.log(person, newPerson); // BOTH objects are modified

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const real_copy_person = Object.assign({}, person);
    real_copy_person.number = 15;
    console.log(person, real_copy_person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const real_copy_person_2 = {...person};
    real_copy_person_2.number = 20;
    console.log(person, real_copy_person_2);  // IT WORKS!

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const person_2levels = {
      name: "Harry",
      age: 44,
      social: {
        twitter: "@eeeee",
        fb: "Harry_eeee"
      }
    }

    let person_2levels_copy = Object.assign({}, person_2levels);
    person_2levels_copy.age = 50;
    person_2levels_copy.social.twitter = "@aaaaaaa";

    console.log(person_2levels, person_2levels_copy);  // The original age was preserved, but Twitter prop was modified;

    let person_2levels_copy_deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person_2levels));
    person_2levels_copy_deep.social.twitter = "@addedeerr";
    console.log(person_2levels, person_2levels_copy_deep); // The original Twitter property is preserved - it works!

    // Conclusion: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) is able to create a deep copy of an object
